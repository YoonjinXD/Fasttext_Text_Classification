[How to Run]

My code file has 4 options. 
Python fasttext_text_classification.py -(int)Ngram -(str)full/part -(bull)Stop word Option -(bull)Statistics

1. Subsampling option is removed because it doesn't support the model effectively.
2. Made a result with a removal of Stop-words option. 
3. The result is based on the Bi-gram including a statistics option.
4. In the result file, the first part is a summary of the result.
5. [O] means a Correct answer and [X] means an Incorrect answer. 

***************************************************************
To check the Best result, Run this command below.
: python fasttext_text_classification.py 2 full True True
